## FAQ
<details><summary>Is it a malware, my mac warns me about it</summary>
  No! it is not. Apple is just strict about installing apps from other places other than App Store, and since I don't have money to publish this app on Appstore, so you'll have to deal with it, or else you could show some support by donating, in which you will not be interested in... So, we'll leave it to that.</details>
